This project is part of my thesis work, **"Latent Space Exploration for Financial Statement Forecasting."** The thesis focuses on building a predictive model to forecast financial statements, leveraging latent space representations using temporal autoencoders and regressors. Due to confidentiality and institutional guidelines, only a shareable portion of the work is provided here.

## üöÄ Thesis Overview

- **Context and Motivation**: Understanding the importance of accurate financial forecasting in the business world and how latent space exploration can improve predictions.
- **Objective**: To explore how deep learning models, particularly autoencoders, can predict future financial trends based on latent representations of input data.
- **System Architecture**: Key components include data pre-processing, temporal autoencoders, regressors, and their connections.
- **Evaluation**: Performance testing of the model using benchmark datasets, and analysis of latent space for prediction improvements.
